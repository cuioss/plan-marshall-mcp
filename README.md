## What is it?

**plan-marshall-mcp** (PM-MCP) is a local MCP server that takes over the process logic
[plan-marshall](https://github.com/cuioss/plan-marshall) implements today as a corpus of filesystem
skills plus locally executed Python scripts. The client asks the server for the state of a plan;
the answer is a representation of that state together with the valid next transitions as links
(hypermedia-driven workflow). The model follows links and contributes judgment only; the server
owns the state machine.

The normative requirements are defined in [Requirements](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/Requirements.adoc), the technical
implementation blueprints in [Specification](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/Specification.adoc), and the delivery order in the
[Roadmap](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/roadmap.adoc). All documents live in the repository
[plan-marshall-documentation](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation). How the implemented
system is built is described in the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/DeveloperGuide.adoc).

> [!NOTE]
> The project is at its beginning: roadmap Milestone 0 (verification first) is complete. Each verified technique
> exists in its target module in a first, minimal form; the workflow engine and the job runtime are not built
> yet. The measurements are recorded in the [Evaluation Reference](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/specification/evaluation.adoc).

## Modules

`pm-mcp-server` (the Quarkus daemon `pm-mcpd`) and the end-to-end tests `pm-e2e`. The plain-Java engine
(`pm-core`, `pm-runtime`, the provider modules) lives in
[pm-mcp-core](https://github.com/plan-marshall/pm-mcp-core). The client contract `pm-api`, the job launcher
`pm-exec`, the STDIO relay `pm-mcp` and the operator CLI `pm-operator` live in
[pm-mcp-clients](https://github.com/plan-marshall/pm-mcp-clients), and the parent POM in
[pm-mcp-parent](https://github.com/plan-marshall/pm-mcp-parent). The listing of the modules, their dependencies, and
the specification each implements is the
[Module Structure Specification](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/specification/module-structure.adoc).

## Technology

Java 25, Quarkus (via `de.cuioss:cui-quarkus-parent`),
[Quarkus MCP Server](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-server),
[cui-http](https://github.com/cuioss/cui-http), picocli, and GraalVM native image for the four binaries.
See [Technology Requirements](https://github.com/plan-marshall/plan-marshall-documentation/blob/main/doc/requirements/09-technology.adoc).

## Build

```bash
# Build and unit tests
./mvnw clean verify

# Integration tests against the packaged daemon and the client JARs
./mvnw clean verify -Pintegration-tests

# Native binaries and the integration tests against them (GRAALVM_HOME and JAVA_HOME point to GraalVM 25)
./mvnw clean verify -Pnative,integration-tests

# Pre-commit: license headers and OpenRewrite recipes - review and commit the resulting diff
./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -DskipTests
```

The daemon listens only on a Unix domain socket below `PM_MCP_BASE` (default `~/.plan-marshall-mcp`); the clients
start it on demand:

```bash
pm-operator runtime start
pm-operator status
```

## Credentials

All secrets (GPG, Sonatype, Sonar, Pages, Release App) are managed at the
[cuioss organization level](https://github.com/cuioss/cuioss-organization) and passed explicitly to the
reusable workflows. No repo-level secrets need to be configured.
